Hi there, this is my practice project from University.
======================================================

IMPORTANT: DON'T delete firstLog and currentLog (you can clear then tho)

Everything is deletable) But it might not work after you delete it,
so you have FILES FOR TESTS and backup folders to try your luck after you destroied my app xD

Thanks for your time
